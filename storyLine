Once upon a time there lived a hare and tortoise in a jungle. One day they decided to have a race. 
The hare was ammused with the idea of running a race with the tortoise. 
They requested the fox to act as a judge.
They started the race and the hare was very soon far out of sight and the tortoise was running at his own pace.
